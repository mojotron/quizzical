# Quizzical

This project is part of [Bob Ziroll](https://twitter.com/bobziroll) React course at [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) learning platform. It's great opportunity to practice React skills. This is capstone course solo project without any hand holding to test your skills. Only thing you got is [figma](https://www.figma.com) file with page design.
Goal of this project is to create react app using [OpenTrivia](https://opentdb.com/) API. Load question data from database, display them on the screen. Wait for user to answer questions and display score to user.

### What have I added

- Tests, unit and integration.
- Question selection by number of question, question difficulty and category.

### What have I learned

- Using figma file to design page layout.
- Handle html entities with DOMparser.parseFromString().
- Better react app file organization, [resource](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUga4-z7b6s) from Web Dev Simplified. Move helper functions to util dir, where every utility function is pure functions with associated tests.
